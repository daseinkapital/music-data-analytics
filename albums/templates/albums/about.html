<h1>About This Project</h1>
<h3>How I Got Here</h3>
<p>I started this project around January 2017 without realizing it. My New Year's Resolution was to listen to 144 new albums every three months. I could feasibly listen to 144 albums every two months, but then I had a month to go back and relisten to a few of them (or catch up if I didn't quite hit my goal for one reason or another). At this time, I knew very little about web development, but I was fairly capable at Python. I was also just about to start work at Excella, a software consulting firm based out of DC. I would work part time at their extension center in Blacksburg while I finished up my Bachelor's Degree in Industrial and Systems Engineering. This is where I would learn everything I needed to make this site possible.</p>
<p>While at Excella, I was staffed on a project to help the PeaceCorps transition their website over to a Django/Wagtail stack. Have you ever noticed how when you visit the Volunteer Openings on PeaceCorps the "What Volunteers Do" tab is already open? Yeah. That was me. This was my first introduction to Django, a web framework built on Python. Django's ability to generate dynamic web pages and manage database objects revolutionized the way I was able to conceptualize web applications and their uses.</p>
<p>Later in the year, I entered a Hack-a-thon with some roommates. Our idea was simple: a web app that allowed you to vote on a collaborative Spotify playlist. While simple in theory, my lack of in-depth knowledge of Django at the time led us to stray down the path of programming in PHP (yuck). Our mission was a failure, but at least there was a lot of free food.</p>
<p>After working with Django long enough, I was able to look back at my experience from the Hack-a-thon and realize where Django could have been utilized to complete our project much faster. Since there was no Hack-a-thon coming up for a long time, but our project idea was good, I decided to give it another go considering everything I'd learned with Django since our first failed attempt. I managed to make a decent landing page and hook up the Spotify API, but the rest of the app never came together because I didn't have the dedication/drive. Almost all of my side projects ended this way, but it was okay in the end, because every time I would get the drive to start a side project like this one, I would get a little bit further and a little bit further, learning better practices along the way. Each step I grew closer to my goal. Now, I am here.</p>
<p>Back to my New Year's Resolution: once I had completed my goal for the albums I wanted to listen to, I had been saving them in large 12x12 images. The site I had been using has since been taken down (s/o Topster), but I had the stored images on my computer. I needed a way to track each album cover name. In many cases, I listened to an album once and never thought about its cover again, which meant I didn't know what albums I'd already given a listen. I began a spreadsheet to make tracking easier. As I added albums I wanted to listen to or albums that were recommended to me, I would add them to the spreadsheet. After a while, I decided I wanted to keep tracking more and more data, even rating the albums by listen (inspired by Anthony Fantano). As this data grew, I knew it was time to do exactly what anyone with a data science and software development background would do: make an app.</p>

<h3>The Future of This Project</h3>
<p>My goal here is to explore various aspects of data science and programming that I have yet to work with. Specifically, I'm hoping to integrate some clustering algorithms, color image segmentation, image pixel analysis, time series analysis, collaborative filtering, and more. As of now, this is the first application I've ever successfully deployed to production.</p>
<p>I've asked some friends for their opinion on the website and layout, potential features and more. Design is only as good as the community that uses it. I'm hoping to bring more interesting data visualization to this website that encourages people to explore new music or deepen their current music taste.</p>

<h3>Where This Project Stands Now</h3>
<p>I'll try my best to update this section as I continually add more features. As of right now, you can view artist pages and album pages to learn more about artists and albums. Every album page has at least one external link that will let you find out more about the album or listen to it. You can also check out the different genres, see what albums I've listened to in your favorite genre/subgenres, and in some cases even find my personal playlist for that genre/subgenre (which many times will contain songs not on albums I've completely listened to). This is the first step in helping people discover new music.</p>
<p>You can also find a nifty little album game I threw together. I'll soon integrate a high score system on it, but that might not be for a while because that's pretty low priority.</p>
