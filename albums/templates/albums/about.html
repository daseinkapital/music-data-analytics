    <h3>How I Got Here</h3>
    <p>I started this project around January 2017 without realizing it. My New Year's Resolution was to listen to 144 new albums every three months. I could feasibly listen to 144 albums every two months, but then I had a month to go back and relisten to a few of them (or catch up if I didn't quite hit my goal for one reason or another). At this time, I knew very little about web development, but I was fairly capable at Python. I was also just about to start work at Excella, a software consulting firm based out of DC. I would work part time at their extension center in Blacksburg while I finished up my Bachelor's Degree in Industrial and Systems Engineering. This is where I would learn everything I needed to make this site possible.</p>
    <p>While at Excella, I was staffed on a project to help the PeaceCorps transition their website over to a Django/Wagtail stack. Have you ever noticed how when you visit the Volunteer Openings on PeaceCorps the "What Volunteers Do" tab is already open? Yeah. That was me. This was my first introduction to Django, a web framework built on Python. Django's ability to generate dynamic web pages and manage database objects revolutionized the way I was able to conceptualize web applications and their uses.</p>
    <p>Later in the year, I entered a Hack-a-thon with some roommates. Our idea was simple: a web app that allowed you to vote on a collaborative Spotify playlist. While simple in theory, my lack of in-depth knowledge of Django at the time led us to stray down the path of programming in PHP (yuck). Our mission was a failure, but at least there was a lot of free food.</p>
    <p>After working with Django long enough, I was able to look back at my experience from the Hack-a-thon and realize where Django could have been utilized to complete our project much faster. Since there was no Hack-a-thon coming up for a long time, but our project idea was good, I decided to give it another go considering everything I'd learned with Django since our first failed attempt. I managed to make a decent landing page and hook up the Spotify API, but the rest of the app never came together because I didn't have the dedication/drive. Almost all of my side projects ended this way, but it was okay in the end, because every time I would get the drive to start a side project like this one, I would get a little bit further and a little bit further, learning better practices along the way. Each step I grew closer to my goal. Now, I am here.</p>
    <p>Back to my New Year's Resolution: once I had completed my goal for the albums I wanted to listen to, I had been saving them in large 12x12 images. The site I had been using has since been taken down (s/o Topster), but I had the stored images on my computer. I needed a way to track each album cover name. In many cases, I listened to an album once and never thought about its cover again, which meant I didn't know what albums I'd already given a listen. I began a spreadsheet to make tracking easier. As I added albums I wanted to listen to or albums that were recommended to me, I would add them to the spreadsheet. After a while, I decided I wanted to keep tracking more and more data, even rating the albums by listen (inspired by Anthony Fantano). As this data grew, I knew it was time to do exactly what anyone with a data science and software development background would do: make an app.</p>

    <h3>The Future of This Project</h3>
    <p>My goal here is to explore various aspects of data science and programming that I have yet to work with. Specifically, I'm hoping to integrate some clustering algorithms, color image segmentation, image pixel analysis, time series analysis, collaborative filtering, and more. As of now, this is the first application I've ever successfully deployed to production.</p>
    <p>I've asked some friends for their opinion on the website and layout, potential features and more. Design is only as good as the community that uses it. I'm hoping to bring more interesting data visualization to this website that encourages people to explore new music or deepen their current music taste.</p>
    <p>Current major feature in development: Active Listening. I am designing an in-browser media player that will allow you to connect your Spotify, start playing music, then as you listen, I'll use ML to try and predict what you'd like to listen to next based on what you skip or what you listen to all the way through. Additionally, I may try to add other panels to this media player, such as potential covers (or originals if the song is a cover).</p>
    <p>Also make this about page looks less like shit.</p>

    <h3>Where This Project Stands Now</h3>
    <p>I'll try my best to update this section as I continually add more features. As of right now, you can view artist pages and album pages to learn more about artists and albums. Every album page has at least one external link that will let you find out more about the album or listen to it. You can also check out the different genres, see what albums I've listened to in your favorite genre/subgenres, and in some cases even find my personal playlist for that genre/subgenre (which many times will contain songs not on albums I've completely listened to). This is the first step in helping people discover new music.</p>
    <p>For other people to help me discover new music, in the "More" tab, you can recommend me an album. In the future, I hope to allow people to track albums I have yet to listen to so that once I rate them they can receive an email saying that I listened to their recommendation (or an album that they wanted my thoughts on).</p>
    <p>5/20/2019 - I can now update my queue automatically by using the Spotify API to check my playlist titled "Music To Figure Out If I Like". While this doesn't affect the user experience, it's a big step because it's made me much more comfortable using the Spotify API, which means very soon this site may be getting a lot of features that call on Spotify to help connect the user to more music and greater analytics.</p>
    <p>9/4/2019 - Spotify will now be checked for playlists that may contain songs from each album. Because of issues with data integrity (for instance, if I have the single version of a song in a playlist and not the album version or the song is remastered and I have the non-remastered version in a playlist) I've had to find some smart ways around this to verify two songs are essentially the same. To this extent, there may be some inaccuracies. If you notice any of these, feel free to report them and I can change them manually.</p>
    <p>There's currently a reporting issue feature. If you believe there is something wrong or broken with the website, let me know so that I can make fixes to it as soon as possible (or maybe those were features, no one can really say).</p>
    <p>You can also find a nifty little album game I threw together. I'll soon integrate a high score system on it, but that might not be for a while because that's pretty low priority.</p>

    <h1 class="center">About the Music</h1>
    <h3>How Do I Find New Music?</h3>
    <p>All of this interest in listening to new music started when I found a chart of essential indie albums. If you look at my first chart, you can tell where it goes alphabetically for a little bit. At this point I realized there was probably a lot of music out there that I needed to force myself to listen to (and I will never regret that decision). So where do I find new music. There are a few answers here.</p>
    <h5>Charts</h5>
    <p>If you know you're in to a specific genre of music, there's a good chance someone has made an essential albums chart. I find charts are really helpful because they're essentially a beginners playlist. By looking at a chart, you can find an album or two that look appealing or sound/look familiar. I've had really good luck doing this.</p>
    <p>If you're feeling really lucky for an artist with a big discography and following or large genre, you might be able to find a flow chart that gives you where to start and directs you through where to go from there based on what you liked or didn't like. These are much harder to come by, but I'm hoping to make a few of these in the future for artists whose discographies I've finished.</p>
    <h5>Music Communities</h5>
    <p>In the early days I became part of two Facebook groups: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/627417830750179/" target="_blank">Patrician Music Chartposting</a> (a slightly more serious place to get good recommendations based on previous taste) and slightly later <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/implyingmusic" target="_blank">>impying we can discuss music</a> which is mostly where people shitpost non-stop. Both of these helped me to get people's opinions on music, see what albums were widely listened to/acclaimed by the general music listening community and to partake in healthy debate over the objective aesthetics of albums.</p>
    <p>For those looking for something more accessible, there are great subreddits such as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/" target="_blank">r/indieheads</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/shoegaze/" target="_blank">r/shoegaze</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vaporwave/" target="_blank">r/vaporwave</a>, or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/wiki/musicsubreddits" target="_blank">whatever you're in to</a>.</p>
    <p>For those looking for something less accessible, you can always check out <a href="https://4chan.org/mu" target="_blank">/mu</a>. Have fun.</p>
    <h5>Indie Music Sites</h5>
    <p>Where better to find music than the source? Everyone has to start somewhere, and while you could go to your local small concert venue and hope you find someone you like, you can always check out their Bandcamp or Soundcloud. Bandcamp tends to be better for finding full albums as it actually allows artists to upload songs in an album, versus Soundcloud which creates a setlist of single tracks. Bandcamp also has great tags and filters that can help you find similar sounding styles that will ideally help you locate exactly what you want.</p>
    <p>Outside of Bandcamp and Soundcloud, one website I've used to find a few bangers is called <a href="https://www.indieshuffle.com/" target="_blank">Indie Shuffle</a>. What I really like about Indie Shuffle is that they let you search by genre and mood, have good descriptions of artist and song background, and they also tell you who the artist sounds like. It's a very intuitive way to discover new music that I'm hoping becomes more widely adopted by the community.</p>
    <h5>Associated Acts and Crew</h5>
    <p>One of the most common ways of finding new music is to look at related bands, but many people overlook associated acts and crew. When you like a band, a quick search of the band will return band members and if they were in any other bands either on the side, before, or after if the band is already split up. In many cases, this music was sound similar, but different because it's being created by some of the same people. That being said, sometimes the reason they have a different project is so that they can do something vastly different.</p>
    <p>Additionally, band members aren't 100% of the final product of an album. If you like one song from an album, but the rest of the album isn't really your thing, then you can always look at who the producer for that album was and see if they've made anything else. The higher their credits are, the higher a chance they had a larger influence on the album. One of my favorite producers is DJ Danger Mouse who has worked on the Gorillaz S/T, Broken Bells, Gnarles Barkley, Black Keys "El Camino", Portugal. the Man's "Evil Friends", and many more.</p>
    <h5>Lastly, That One Song You Like</h5>
    <p>If you listen to the radio often, chances are you like a lot of single songs from an artist. If you really enjoyed that song, why not give the album a listen? You may find that some of your favorite songs are the deep cuts off an album that you'd only heard singles from.</p>
